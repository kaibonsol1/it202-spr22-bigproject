#Testing

Around 640 people have visited my grade distribution app, and I received a few suggestions which resulted in further implementations, I also received some suggestions which I chose not to implement.

One suggestion was to add the frequency of grades in the visualization, I did a simple frequency calculation for each letter grade and put this as a precentage in the info box that pops up when you hover over a column.

Another suggestion was to add details for satisfactory/unsatisfactory classes, which I did by adding an information box below the visualization that has the text "S/U: " followed by numbers divided by a slash representing satisfactory and unsatisfactory accordingly. I also added total registrants and W's to this information box.

Another suggestion was to add RateMyProfessor data to each class page, this did not work directly since there is no RMP API and I do not want to mess with web scraping; however, I was able to add a link which utilized the search mechanics of RMP based on the university and professor's name to show the correct RMP (for the most part).

I had the suggestion to change the list such that each item can drop down to show the grade distribution, so that the grades can be shown side by side for different classes. I did not get around to implementing this, but may in the future.
